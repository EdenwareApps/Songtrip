## Songtrip generates related playlists from music files on your computer.

If you don’t like spending money subscribing to a music streaming service or if you zeal over your music collection, you probably have a folder full of music files on your computer.

That’s great, but every time you want to listen some music you have to spend some time putting together your playlist or you hear an already assembled playlist that becomes repetitive or that’s not exactly what you wanted to hear at the moment.

That’s when Songtrip can help you, it can build playlists based on a song or mood automatically. You just need to choose a song and Songtrip will put together a list of related songs in a few seconds for you to listen on your favorite player, so you can keep your vibe.

Even if you don’t have a specific song in mind, you can tell Songtrip how you’re feeling with very few clicks and generate a playlist easily that is in tune with your current mood.

You can call it easily with the right click by clicking on a song too! Don’t waste any more time (literally) and let Songtrip prepare your playlists!
