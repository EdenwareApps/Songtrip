   "ABOUT_INFO": "Songtrip is a playlist generator software. It analyzes various pieces of information to come up with the perfect list for you to listen to.\n\nAll you need to do is tell Songtrip what you're in the mood for, which you can do by simply choosing a song from the library or giving Songtrip your current \"mood\".\n\nFor more accurate results, this program uses data generated by the Essentia software and the AcousticBrainz platform, two grandiose projects.\n\nNote: Songtrip only analyzes the melody and rhythm of the songs, not the lyrics.",
